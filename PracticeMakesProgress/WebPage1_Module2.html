    If you are stressed and need a break, try this mind exercise and then go
    back, it really helps

    <ul>
      <li>5 things you can see</li>
      <li>4 things you can hear</li>
      <li>3 things you can feel</li>
    </ul>

    There!, now you can go back to your work and it will be easy breezy Still
    stressed, let us try one of these physical exercise then:

    <ol>
      <li>stand up and march in place for 2 mins</li>
      <li>stand up and sit down 3 times</li>
      <li>
        stand up, stretch, and go to kitchen, fill your water cup and come back
        and sit
      </li>
    </ol>
